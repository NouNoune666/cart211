                    <p>Between May and July 2017, American credit bureau Equifax was breached. Private records of 147.9
                        million Americans along
                        with 15.2 million British citizens and about 19,000 Canadian citizens were compromised in the
                        breach, making it one of
                        the largest cybercrimes related to identity theft. Equifax discovered the breach at the end of
                        July, but did not
                        disclose it to the public until September 2017. In a settlement with the United States Federal
                        Trade Commission, Equifax
                        offered affected users settlement funds and free credit monitoring.</p>
                    <p>Information accessed in the breach included first and last names, Social Security numbers, birth
                        dates, addresses and,
                        in some instances, driver's license numbers for an estimated 143 million Americans, based on
                        Equifax' analysis. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Equifax_data_breach"

                    <p>Information on almost 14 million British residents was also compromised. as well as 8,000
                        Canadian
                        residents. An additional 11,670 Canadians were affected as well, later revealed by Equifax.
                        Credit card
                        numbers for approximately 209,000 U.S. consumers, and certain dispute documents with personally
                        identifiable information
                        for approximately 182,000 U.S. consumers were also accessed.</p>
                    <p>An Equifax internal audit in 2015 revealed a significant backlog of unresolved vulnerabilities.
                        The audit found that
                        Equifax was not adhering to its own patching schedules, IT staff lacked a comprehensive asset
                        inventory, and the company
                        did not prioritise patches based on the criticality of IT assets. Additionally, the patching
                        process relied on an honour
                        system, without strict enforcement. The report outlined actions to improve security measures,
                        but by the time of the
                        breach two years later, many had not been implemented.
