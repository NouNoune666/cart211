                    <p>It has been reported that this was a significant data leak, affecting approximately 500 to 700
                        million LinkedIn user
                        accounts. This is an alarming number and should be taken seriously, as it can have severe
                        implications for both the
                        company and its customers. The hackers gained access to names, emails, phone numbers, and other
                        personal information —
                        everything you would want to know about a person if you are trying to commit fraud or identity
                        theft against them.</p>
                    <p>In June 2021, a hacker by the username “TomLiner” advertised for sale, on a darknet forum,
                        information of 700 million
                        LinkedIn users – that’s estimated to be around 90% of its total users! The data is now being
                        sold for $5,000. If
                        validated, this would be the largest LinkedIn data leak to date. The same seller was also behind
                        the 500 million
                        LinkedIn records advertised for sale last April 2021. Later, a sample of 1 million users was
                        published on the dark web,
                        verified legitimate, and confirmed to be tied to real LinkedIn users. The data seems it was
                        up-to-date with samples
                        taken from 2020 to 2021. <a

                    <p>Recently, LinkedIn’s API (Application Programming Interface) was misused by a third party to gain
                        access to the personal
                        data of millions of users. The misuse of this API opens up potential security risks for many
                        people and companies who
                        use LinkedIn as their primary platform for business connections. LinkedIn said it had taken
                        steps to remedy the
                        situation. In this latest data leak, LinkedIn claims that this was a case of data scraping and
                        data aggregation from
                        different sources and not a data breach. They claim that no private LinkedIn member data was
                        exposed; rather, this data
                        leak was an aggregation of data from several websites and companies, as well as publicly
                        viewable member profile data.</p>
                    <p>In the published sample of 1 million entries, it contained email addresses, full names, phone
                        numbers, physical
                        addresses, geo-location records, LinkedIn user profile, personal and professional background,
                        gender, and other social
                        media account usernames. The data being sold exposed no passwords or credit card details. <a
